# CharacterCreation
This is a example of how to make a simple, yet effective start of using other classes to another main class using Java.

It starts off with making couple of classes seperately, which is Hair color, Gender and Classes. After that you you'll have to make a Main Class of the project.
However the method of this project can be remade in other several ways, it can be done with arrays, while loops, for loops, but what I did is a starter for those who are learning,
this is my first ever project I made after university because of boredom, so I hope this helps most of you and if you have any certain ideas, you can go ahead and comment straight away or just remake it and make the way you know best.
